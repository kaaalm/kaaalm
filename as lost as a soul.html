				"one day i got lost, since then i've been going along without ever finding myself again. <br>
				like a soul in a space stolen from reality. <br>
				an imaginary immensity to lose itself forever." <br>

				<br>

				i had a normal childhood, <br>
				raised by my grandmother and my mom. <br>
				my dad died nearly 2 decades ago and my mom never wanted to find anyone else, <br>
				i don't blame her at all. <br>

				<br>

				without a father figure, <br>
				with my mom working a lot as a nurse, <br>
				i've often been alone, <br>
				that forged in me many faculties : <br>
				curiosity, a thirst for discovery, both tangible and intangible. <br>
				about our world, its inhabitants, its cultures <br>
				and a love for making art, <br>
				a love for my creative imagination, <br> 
				and also a love for nature. <br>

				<br>

				but that forged also many burdens : <br>
				a kind of marginality with our society, <br>
				that brings me some of mental issues <br>
				who follow me arround all the time <br>
				and many social barriers, particularly friendships, but above all, <br>
				i have some difficulty opening up to the professional world, <br>
				particularly in the field of photography. <br>

				<br>

				but i know, <br>
				you, <br>
				me, <br>
				don't have to shine <br>

after high school,
i didn't like myself,

i began lost myself in nature, i felt in love with trekking and that helped me a lot
lost myself in fareway places where nobody goes,
taking photos and spending my time.
i had the time and the means to learn what i wanted to do and who i really was,
and to become the artist that i am now.

but this is mentally hard, i'm almost alone on all my adventure.
i feel almost alone every day in fact,
and when i return to work in my place,
my negative thoughts come back :
i'm always under pressure,
and i feel lost with all my problems.

it's quite hard to look good outside and feel sick inside.
it's quite hard to feel trapped while being free.

lost in our system society,
lost in our world,
lost in my feelings
	and in my thoughts,
lost in my artistic path,
lost in my wishes,
lost in this awful cycle
like an ant lost in a vast wood
	and nearly,
lost as a soul

every day i try,
try to be better.

i move forward without ever knowing at all if tomorrow will be a better day
or just another one
where i'll feel lost.

"as lost as a soul" is a photograph series witch brings together
my feelings of solitude and my mixed-media photography.

i explore these worlds of immaginary reality through my photos
which i try to work on like paintings,
using a range of mixed media techniques and alternative photo processes.

i don't know if i'm going to stop this series
i wonder if this last one isn't something bigger
something that will follow me
