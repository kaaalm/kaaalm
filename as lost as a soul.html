				"one day i got lost, since then i've been going along without ever finding myself again. <br>
				like a soul in a space stolen from reality. <br>
				an imaginary immensity to lose itself forever." <br>

				<div class="double">
					<img class="carréDuo" src="photos/souls/horse in the city.jpg">
					<p class="bio" style="text-align: right;">i had a normal childhood, <br>
				raised by my grandmother and my mom. <br>
				my dad died nearly 2 decades ago and my mom never wanted to find anyone else, <br>
				i don't blame her at all. <br></p>

				i had a normal childhood, <br>
				raised by my grandmother and my mom. <br>
				my dad died nearly 2 decades ago and my mom never wanted to find anyone else, <br>
				i don't blame her at all. <br>

				<br>

				without a father figure, <br>
				with my mom working a lot as a nurse, <br>
				i've often been alone, <br>
				that forged in me many faculties : <br>
				curiosity, a thirst for discovery, both tangible and intangible. <br>
				about our world, its inhabitants, its cultures <br>
				and a love for making art, <br>
				a love for my creative imagination, <br> 
				and also a love for nature. <br>

				<br>

				but that forged also many burdens : <br>
				a kind of marginality with our society, <br>
				that brings me some of mental issues <br>
				who follow me arround all the time <br>
				and many social barriers, particularly friendships, but above all, <br>
				i have some difficulty opening up to the professional world, <br>
				particularly in the field of photography. <br>

				<br>

				i began lost myself in nature, i felt in love with trekking and that helped me a lot. <br>
				lost myself in fareway places where nobody goes, <br>
				taking photos and spending my time. <br>
				i had the time and the means to learn what i wanted to do and who i really was, <br>
				to become the human that i am now. <br>

				and when i return to work in my place,
				my negative thoughts come back.

				but i know, <br>
				you, <br>
				me, <br>
				don't have to shine <br>	

				it's mentally hard, every fucking day. <br>
				i feel almost alone anytime in fact, <br>
				i'm always under pressure, <br>
				and i feel lost with all my problems. <br>

				it's quite hard to look good outside and feel sick inside. <br>
				it's quite hard to feel trapped while being free. <br>

				lost in our system society, <br>
				lost in our world, <br>
				lost in my feelings <br>
					and in my thoughts, <br>
				lost in my artistic path, <br>
				lost in my wishes, <br>
				lost in this awful cycle <br>
				like an ant lost in a vast wood <br>
					and nearly, <br>
				lost as a soul <br>

				every day i try, <br>
				try to make my brain better. <br>

				i move forward without ever knowing at all if tomorrow will be a better day <br>
				or just another one <br>
				where i'll feel lost. <br>

				"as lost as a soul" is a photograph series witch brings together
				my feelings of solitude, my mental health difficulties, my treks, my adventures and my mixed-media photography.

				i explore these worlds of immaginary reality through my photos
				which i try to work on like paintings,
				using a range of mixed media technics and alternative photo processes.

				i don't know if i'm going to stop this series
				i wonder if this last one isn't something bigger
				something that will follow me
