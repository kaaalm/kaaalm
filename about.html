            hi, i'm tom, <br>
			or "kaaalm".<br>
			as far as the word "possible" allows, <br>
			i wish to discover sources of emotions in what the world can offer me, <br>
            in the hope of bringing them out through my art, <br>
			essentially in my photos. <br>

			<br>

        	i'm a world explorer, <br>
			a wanderer accross the countryside. <br>

			<br>

			doing essentially a lot of treks alone, <br>
			and trying to spend a lot of time with my friends, <br>
			making a lot of photos and stuffs related to it. <br>
			
			<br>

			i'm a mixed media artist focused on photographic medium, <br>
			working with photos as if they were paintings. <br>
			
			<br>

			my wish is to provoke a certain openness through the emotions <br>
			that can be encountered in my work, <br>
			an openness to the beauty of this world and its inhabitants, <br>
			and an openess to your deepest feelings. <br>

			<br>

			through and beyond my vision and everything else, <br>
			i try to take a humanistic approach to life.

my dad died nearly 2 decades ago and my mom never wanted to find anyone else,
she only lives for her job as an emergency nurse.
i don't blame her at all.

i had a normal childhood,
raised by my grandmother and my mom.
my grandfather died when i was young
so, without a father figure, with my mom working quite a lot,
i've often been alone,
that forged in me many faculties :
curiosity, a thirst for discovery, both tangible and intangible.
about our world, its inhabitants, its cultures
and through my love of art and nature.

but that forged also many burdens :
a kind of marginality with our society,
that brings me some of mental issues
who follow me arround all the time
and many social barriers, particularly friendships, but above all, 
i have some difficulty opening up to the professional world, particularly in the field of photography.
at the moment, i still don't know whether I'll be able to become professionally independent.

but i know,
i don't have to shine

during this time, i was also the fat guy who was always left in the background,
less interesting than the others,
too nice to stand out.

after high school and because of my father's death,
i had the time and the means to learn what i wanted to do and who i really was,
and to become the artist that i am.
but i "lost" almost 2 years in audiovisual and photo schools,
in fact : i didn't spend all my time like i wanted.

because of that and the fact that i didn't like myself,
i began lost myself in nature, i felt in love with trekking and that helped me a lot
now i love running, cycling, climbing, running during my treks...
i love to lost myself in fareway places where nobody goes,
taking photos and spending my time.
but this is mentally hard, i'm almost alone on all my journeys.

and when i return to work in my appartment,
my negative thoughts come back
and i feel lost with all these problems.

lost in our system society,
lost in our world,
lost in my feelings
	and in my thoughts,
lost in my artistic path,
lost in my wishes,
lost in this cycle
like an ant lost in a vast wood
	and nearly,
lost as a soul

and even though i shouldn't worry about it,
i don't feel legitimate in my current situation.



"one day i got lost, since then i've been going along without ever finding myself again.
like a soul in a space stolen from reality.
an imaginary immensity to lose itself forever."

i explore these worlds of immaginary reality through my photos
which i try to work on like paintings,
using a range of mixed media techniques and alternative photo processes.

"al lost as a soul" is a photograph series witch brings together
my feelings of solitude and my mixed-media photography.


to be honest, the more i work on this series since 2023,
the better i feel about my old burdens.
i don't know yet if i'm going to stop this series
and i wonder if this last one isn't something bigger
something that followed me
who can follow me forever

"hwado"
caution : this series is still in progress

"hwado" is a Korean term symbolysing the entire journey of creativity and imagination through the realisation of an artistic act

each picture is a reflection of light, colors and textures evolution through the post production with mixed media picture
when i'm back home, getting back into my routine
what is hard for me at this time
i feel that the mountains heal me but i encountered some difficulties this year due to long periods of solitude during my treks
my feelings are always kind of paradoxal
